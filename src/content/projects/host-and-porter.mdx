I was hired by [Caava design](https://caavadesign.com/) to build a product catalog website for their client Host & Porter. I have been following their owner and creative director Cody Small on [behance.com](https://www.behance.net/codysmall) for some time and was excited to have an opportunity to work with them.

## WordPress Development

The client selected WordPress as the platform of choice. The product catalog contained 450 SKU's, 26 collections (products grouped by design), and 6 categories. The project had the size and complexity of an e-commerce store without the cart. I created a custom WordPress plugin that would allow for the management of the catalog within the admin UI.

## Plugin Features

Products in a collection come in a variety of colors. I built the WordPress plugin to allow for multiple product images to be uploaded and grouped by color. The plugin also has a merchandising feature that allows for the selection of related products. I also installed two additional plugins, Advanced Custom Fields Pro, and Instagram Views to complete the project. [Advanced Custom Fields Pro](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/pro/) allowed me to create editable fields to manage all content in the page layouts. Marco Pelloni, a fellow Jiu-Jitsu practitioner, developed The Instagram Views plugin that was used on the homepage to pull images from the Instagram API. To [document the plugin](https://sites.google.com/view/hp-wordpress-site/), I created a 13-page website on Google Sites with annotated screenshots.

## Responsive Design & Scale

The Caava design team designed the website for mobile and desktop. In one of our review meetings, we decided to take it a step further and also make it big screen responsive as well. I built out the views to be scalable and grow to fit the screen while maintaining the same ratio. To help increase page speed, I also added a lazy loading script to load images only when scrolled into view.

## Conclusion

Caava Design wrote a [case study](https://caavadesign.com/project/host-porter-brand-packaging-and-website/) outlining the full scope of the project. I got to challenge myself by designing a complex feature into a single WordPress Plugin while also building the beautiful front end of the website. Both Caava Design and Host & Porter were happy with the finished product, and I have to say I was pretty pleased too.
