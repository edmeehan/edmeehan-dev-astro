      Users expect websites to be fast, secure, and responsive, but many businesses struggle with outdated, slow, and insecure technology.

        testimonial: >-
          Ed is perhaps the most detail-oriented, design attentive developer I have worked with. On the multiple projects we collaborated on, he always went the extra mile to lay a good foundation for his work, then made suggestions on how to improve or optimize the final product I was looking for. I've never seen a design I've created for a website executed with as much precision as Ed was able to achieve on our projects. This is something I consider extremely rare in the development world and highly recommend working with him.

          It's been a great experience working with Ed! He has excellent attention to detail and I rarely have feedback when he delivers updates. I value his advice and feedback as we work through problems and I have full trust in his abilities to get work done efficiently and correctly.
