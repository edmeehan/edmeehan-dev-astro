      <p class="eyebrow">Fast, Secure, Scalable</p>


      <h1 class="h1">I build <strong>supercharged</strong> websites that engage
      users and build online <strong>growth</strong></h1>


      Users expect websites to be fast, secure, and responsive, but many
      businesses struggle with outdated, slow, and insecure technology.


      With a focus on modern frameworks and tools, I deliver websites built on
      the latest web technology. Translation? Faster page speeds, superior
      security, and the ability to handle high demand through scalability.

        testimonial: >-
          Ed has been a reliable, long-term partner to Clearhead for several
          years while delivering high-quality code for a number of key projects.
          He’s meticulous when it comes to ensuring he understands the scope and
          requirements of the work, and he takes pride in ensuring his work is
          well tested and of high quality.

        testimonial: >-
          Ed is perhaps the most detail-oriented, design attentive developer I
          have worked with. On the multiple projects we collaborated on, he
          always went the extra mile to lay a good foundation for his work, then
          made suggestions on how to improve or optimize the final product I was
          looking for. I've never seen a design I've created for a website
          executed with as much precision as Ed was able to achieve on our
          projects. This is something I consider extremely rare in the
          development world and highly recommend working with him.

        testimonial: >-
          It's been a great experience working with Ed! He has excellent
          attention to detail and I rarely have feedback when he delivers
          updates. I value his advice and feedback as we work through problems
          and I have full trust in his abilities to get work done efficiently
          and correctly.
