      <h1 class="h1"><strong>Data-driven</strong> insights through custom tracking in Google Analytics to inform your <strong>marketing strategy</strong></h1>


      Marketing without data to support your efforts is like shooting in the dark. Without the ability to understand and analyze the data, you may be throwing your resources away. Data-driven insights are essential for informed and effective marketing.


      With my strong background in marketing analytics strategy, I have a demonstrated ability to effectively plan, set up, and manage Analytics for businesses and organizations of all sizes.
