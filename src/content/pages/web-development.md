      <h4 class="h2"><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong></h4>


      Have a question? I have answered some common questions here. Don't see an answer to your question? [Ask me here](/contact/).
    faqs:
      - question: Do you build Shopify eCommerce stores?
        answer: >-
          Yes! Shopify is my preferred eCommerce platform. I have experience building Shopify hosted stores using their internal CMS and Liquid templating language, as well as building JamStack eCommerce stores using a 3rd party headless CMS and the Shopify APIs.
      - question: Do you offer design services?
        answer: >-
          Though I have experience as a graphic and UI designer, I do not offer any design services to my clients. However, I can bring a designer onto the project or work with your internal designers.
      - question: Do you build WordPress sites?
        answer: >-
          I have built many WordPress projects in the past, but I decided in 2019 to no longer support or develop themes or plugins for WordPress. As a platform it does not offer the speed, security, and publishing features I require for my services. If you are looking for WordPress development and need help finding a developer I can point you in the right direction.
      - question: Can I edit or publish changes to my site if you build it?
        answer: >-
          Yes, it is one of the main features of the websites I build. I will select a Headless CMS that works best for your needs and build a site that will allow you to edit pages and layouts, publish new pages, and manage users and permissions. I have years of experience working with marketing and content teams, so I understand the need for a pain-free publishing process.
