We have this now thanks to a content management system Ed trained us to use. Our website looks great and it is easy to update. I'm now confident that I can update our website, I also know I can reach out to Ed for assistance. Thanks again for being supportive and thorough."

On the multiple projects we collaborated on, he always went the extra mile to lay a good foundation for his work, then made suggestions on how to improve or optimize the final product I was looking for. I've never seen a design I've created for a website executed with as much precision as Ed was able to achieve on our projects. This is something I consider extremely rare in the development world and highly recommend working with him."
